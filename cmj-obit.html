<P ALIGN=JUSTIFY>
Delia Derbyshire, British pioneer of
electronic music, died in Northampton, England, on 3 July 2001, aged
64. Born in Coventry, England, she was educated at Coventry Grammar School
and Girton College, Cambridge, graduating in music and mathematics. She
joined the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) in 1960 as a studio
manager and transferred in 1962 to the Radiophonic Workshop, where she
remained until 1973. During that time she produced music and sound for
almost 200 radio and television programs. In 1963, she realized one of
the first electronic signature tunes ever used on television: Ron Grainer's
score for the science fiction series, Dr Who. Using concrete sources and
the Workshop's oscillators and filters, she produced what is probably one
of the most famous television themes ever. Although Dr Who made the
Radiophonic Workshop nationally famous, it was Derbyshire's other drama
and features work that showed her greatest talent, particularly her 1964
collaborations with the poet and dramatist Barry Bermange (The Dreams
and Amor Dei) and her work for the documentary series The World About
Us. In 1967, she worked on Guy Woolfendens electronic score for Peter
Hall's Royal Shakespeare Company production of Macbeth, and on Hall's film
Work is a Four Letter Word. In the mid 1960s she worked extensively
with Peter Zinovieff, the synthesizer pioneer. During this time, she
also worked with a wide range of composers and musicians including The
Beatles, Ianni Christou, Roberto Gerhard (on Anger of Achilles), George
Martin, Peter Maxwell Davies, Harry Nilsson, Pink Floyd, and Karlheinz
Stockhausen. She was Luciano Berio's assistant at the 1962 Dartington
summer school. Later, in collaboration with Brian Hodgson and David
Vorhaus, she set up Kaleidophon, an independent studio where she worked
on the classic album Electric Storm (1968), which was credited to White
Noise and released on Island Records. This studio continued to put
together electronic music for the London theatre of the late 1960s.
In 1975 she left the BBC and after a short period with a private
studio she gave up compositional work for many years. Recently, she had
returned to take an interest in electronic music encouraged by members of a
younger generation, such as Sonic Boom and Aphex Twin, to whom she had become
a cult figure. Her works from the 1960s and 1970s continue to be used
on radio and television some thirty years later. Delia Derbyshire used
an analytical approach to synthesize complex sounds from electronic
sources. The maths of sound seemed to come naturally to her, but she
believed that the way the ear and brain perceive sound should have
dominance over any basic mathematical theory.
