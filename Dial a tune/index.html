KIRSTEN CUBITT visits the<BR>BBC's radiophonic workshop
</B></BIG></P>
<P>
IT STRUCK ME immediately as the contemporary equivalent of an alchemist's
kitchen: to my lay eye the BBC's radiophonic workshop in Maida Vale took
shape as  an esoteric, slightly scary clutter of instruments, some quite
dusty, other unintelligibly new, with fussy, jiggling dials, and a running
commentary of gulping noises, and bumps, and whinnies.
<P>
I was at the workshop primarily to meet its only woman member, Delia
Derbyshire. While she vanished to unfile some printed material which, she
promised, would explain the setup with suitable simplicity, I had a chance
to look over some of the equipment. A set of glass containers reminded me of
the medieval waterclock I once saw in a cathedral. Near them stood a rather
pretty box with perpetually changing numbers chasing each other across its
face, and farther over was something they swore was called a wobbulator. I
didn't know whether to laugh politely or to believe it. Its job, I learned,
was to feed frequencies into the blue box, so that it could count them.
<P>
Most interesting, of all the hardware in the studio, is a brand new EMS VC3
[sic], a voltage controlled studio in itself, housed in a casing about the
size of a small desk. Trustingly propped for the moment on an ageing swivel
chair, this treasure box is said to be the equivalent of a whole roomful of
ordinary instruments and by the end of the year the workshop hopes to take
delivery of a &pound;6,000 version on a larger scale, and even cleverer.
<P>
Though we hear a lot of it, not always wittingly, I think many people are
as puzzled as I was about the music and sounds manufactured in this workshop
and others like it. What, exactly, does &ldquo;electronic music&rdquo; mean?
How is it made? What is it used for?
<P>
The BBC's own workshop was set up in 1958 by two studio managers at
Broadcasting House, Daphne Oram, and the present organiser, Desmond Briscoe,
mainly to handle special effects for radio drama. Now its range extends over
the whole spectrum of sound and vision, with television taking 60 per cent
of the output. Cheery call-signs for local radio stations, evocative sounds,
and music for documentaries, plays, and weird effects for series like
&ldquo;Dr Who&rdquo; are all the stock-in-trade of the workshop's four
composers.
<P>
Delia Derbyshire, though only just into her thirties, is the
longest-established of the four, and while Desmond Briscoe is away on
extended leave she is monitoring the department. She sorted out for me,
first of all, the basic definitions. Musique concrete has sound as its
source, produced over a microphone and then deployed in different ways.
Electronic music has as its source only electrical impulses. The workshop,
of course, handles both.
<P>
The four staffers at Maida Vale, work on over 200 programmes a year, though
this figure may include intensive treatments for six episodes of a series or
one sound for a regional play. They specialise more by inclination than
intent. John Baker is in demand for his catchy tunes--the call-signs are
his.
<P>
David Cairns, the youngest at 29, straight-haired and monkish of feature, is
preoccupied with medieval music and with jazz. His work for &ldquo;The Hero
Rises Up&rdquo; helped to win its nomination for this year's Italia Prize.
It was he who worked on the sound of the marathon &ldquo;<I>Rus.</I>&rdquo;
Brian Hodgson is the progenitor of the notorious Dalek voices, a flamboyant
figure with corn-coloured curls.
<P>
Like her colleagues, Delia is composer and technician in one. On the BBC's
record of some of the workshop's compositions, her pieces tend to have
atmospheric names like &ldquo;Blue Veils and Golden Sand.&rdquo; That was for
a documentary on deserts and her music led the credit titles to the uneven
beat of a camel train across the screen. Another of her compositions
introduced &ldquo;<I>Zoos of the World</I>&rdquo; with a stunning fantasia of
animal cries (in which the lion's roar was actually uttered by one of the
workshop's multi-talented operational assistants).
&ldquo;Towards Tomorrow&rdquo; is another of &ldquo;her&rdquo; programmes.
<P>
It is a demanding profession, and unusual for a woman. The only surviving
daughter of a sheet-metal worker in Coventry, she was always good at music,
though she says her grammar school resented the time she spent at the piano.
Her teachers steered her towards maths and physics, and it was to read maths
that she went to Girton, at one of its vintage periods when Judy Innes, the
fashion writer, Andrew Sinclair, novelist and historian, and Peter Cook were
in residence at Cambridge. Enthusiasm for acoustics and theories of sound
led her to move across to the music faculty for part II of her degree,
working for her LRAM in the meantime.
<P>
The corporation, usually so jealous of its servants, has allowed her to
build up her own studio with Brian Hodgson, in Camden Town. As
&ldquo;Kaleidophon,&rdquo; they have done the music and effects for the
Round House &ldquo;Hamlet,&rdquo; the Greenwich &ldquo;Medea,&rdquo; and
Peter Logan's Mechanical Ballet. This summer, Edward Lucie Smith, who had
worked with Delia on a schools radio programme, asked her to set some verse
for an evening called &ldquo;Poets in Prison&rdquo; at the City of London
Festival.
<P>
But her studio at Maida Vale remains in the foreground. &ldquo;People seem
to think I'm just working with funny noises, that it isn't quite serious or
something,&rdquo; she told me. &ldquo;I think a lot of people have a sort of
block about electronic music, they think it must sound frightening and
oppressive."
