The WikiDelia is closed to the BBC
</H1>
<P>
Most of Delia's beautiful music and sounds are being hoarded by 
Mark Ayres on the tapes from the Radiophonic Workshop and
no one at the BBC takes the responsability for getting her life's work
digitized and published, nor will they allow anyone else to do so.
<P>
Until all of the surviving sound from Delia's most creative years is published,
the WikiDelia will remain closed to the BBC.
You can still consult it from home or from your cellphone.

<H2>What music?</H2>
Here is a list of the music Delia created for the BBC,
mostly surviving in one or two copies on the 50-year-old tapes
from the BBC Radiophonic Workshop.
<P>
<U>Legend</U><BR>
- The unpublished music has its TRW numbers <B>in bold</B>,<BR>
- where the tape is "not to be found" the TRW number is <del>struck out</del><BR>
- and if it is <B><del>both</del></B> it means it is unpublished and they
don't have a copy of it.
<P>
