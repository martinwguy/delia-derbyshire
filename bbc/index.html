Delia's unpublished BBC work
</H1>
<P>
Here is a list of the music and sounds created by Delia Derbyshire at the BBC
in her ten most creative years from 1962 to 1973.
Of the 138 TV and radio programmes on which she worked,
only 15 short pieces have ever been published by the BBC on record.
The rest is being hoarded by Mark Ayres on the 50-year-old
tapes from the Radiophonic Workshop.
<P>
Delia herself tried to get the best of it published on CD in the 1990s but
Ayres thwarted her by trying to charge her five hundred pounds per tape,
and in recent years a record label tried to publish a compendium of her work,
only to be dicked around by him so badly that eventually they ran away screaming.
<P>
Until someone at the BBC takes responsability for getting her life's work
digitized and published, the WikiDelia will remain closed to the BBC.

<H2>What music?</H2>
<U>Legend</U><BR>
- The unpublished music has its TRW numbers <B>in bold</B>,<BR>
- where the tape is "not to be found" the TRW number is <del>struck out</del><BR>
- and if it is <B><del>both</del></B> it means it is unpublished and they
don't have a copy of it.
