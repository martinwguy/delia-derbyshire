This is the master copy of my works for delia-derbyshire.net
studying electronic music pioneer Delia Derbyshire from the sixties.

The web site, a single-page attempt to catalogue her works, is in index.php
from which index.html and index.htm are created, without and with links to
all the MP3 files respectively, as well as copies of all the documents it
links to.

Scores of her music, in Lilypond, are in the "scores" folder.

There is Bourne shell and C code to create the spectrograms used in the
WikiDelia and to convert the spectrograms in James Percival's thesis
back into audio, all in the "anal" folder,

quotes.txt is my personal collection of anything Delia is known to have said.

Any questions, delia.derbyshire.net@gmail.com
