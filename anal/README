Sound analysis tools created for Delia Derbyshire's music
---------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the source code for the programs I've written to
analyse Delia's music. These programs are my own original work.

mkjpg.sh	Produces the log-frequency-axis spectrograms used in
		wikidelia.net.
		I had had this idea in 1990 but only got there in August 2012.
		See http://wikidelia.net/wiki/Spectrograms

run.sh/run.c	Converts the spectrograms in James Percival's thesis back
		into audio. Sound quality varies according to the
		resolution of the spectrogram in question.
		I have never heard of anyone else ever attempting to do this;
		surely I can't be the first!
