Sound analysis tools created for Delia Derbyshire's music
---------------------------------------------------------

This folder contains the source code for the programs I've written to
analyse Delia's music. These programs are my own original work.

mkjpg.sh	Produces the log-frequency-axis spectrograms used in
		wikidelia.net.
		I had wanted to do this since 1990 and got there in 201X.
		Log-f spectrograms are rare but not unknown.
		See http://wikidelia.net/wiki/Spectrograms

run.sh/run.c	Converts the spectrograms in James Percival's thesis back
		into audio. Sound quality varies graetly according to the
		resolution of the spectrogram in question.
		I have never heard of anyone attempting to do this.
