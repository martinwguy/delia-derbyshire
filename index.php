Delia Derbyshire is one of the earliest and most influential electronic
sound synthesists. She was musically active from 1962 until the mid seventies,
then briefly again for a few years before she died in 2001 at the age of 64.
<P>
Although her revolutionary sounds are familiar to over a hundred million
people through the theme to the television series "Doctor Who" and the seminal
album of 1969 "An Electric Storm" she was hardly ever credited and her name is
almost unknown.
The bulk of her
musical production and atmospheric sound for television and radio programmes
is on tape in the BBC Sound Archives. After her death, 267 tapes from her attic
as well as a box of her papers were consigned to the archive, then in 2007
donated to Manchester University Center for Screen Studies who have digitized
them but only three new tracks have been released since then, on compilation
albums with music from other composers.
Most will probably never be heard again.
Mark Ayres made a catalogue of the BBC archives and of the attic tapes
but neither has been published.
<P>
I originally compiled this chronology from what I could find of
Delia Derbyshire's music from material found on the web, adding info from
people contacted by email.
For biographical material and lists of commercial albums containing her music
consult the canonical site
<A HREF="http://www.delia-derbyshire.org">delia-derbyshire.org</A>.
<P>
Where I have been able to find a date the order here is chronological, though
for many pieces I have only seen a passing mention of their existence and have
had to guess roughly where to insert them into the list.
Others are inserted at random.
I am always pleased to receive suggestions for better ordering,
or news of other material of which I am ignorant,
as well as reports of errors in the site contents, however minor.

Delia was born on the 5th of May 1937.
<P>
"<I>I was always into the theory of sound even in the 6th form. The physics
teacher refused to teach us acoustics but I studied it myself and did very
well. It was always a mixture of the mathematical side and music. Also,
radio had been my love since childhood because I came from just a humble
background with relatively few books and radio was my education. It was
always my little ambition to get into the BBC.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The only way into the workshop was to be a trainee studio
manager. This is because the workshop was purely a service department
for drama. The BBC made it quite clear that they didn't employ composers
and we weren't supposed to be doing music.</I>"

Delia joined the BBC Radiophonic Workshop in 1962.

superb subversion of a phrase which would normally evoke (especially
in the context of 1962) new-found affluence, spare time and leisure,
now rendered alienated, distant and isolated."

"<I>In those days people were so cynical about electronic music and so
Doctor Who was my private delight. It proved them all wrong.</I>"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Delia in 1993, according to
<A HREF="http://www.millenniumeffect.co.uk/audio/theme.php">The
Millenium Effect</A>
<P>
"<I>The first producer of Doctor Who, Verity Lambert, she had in
her mind </I>Les Structures Sonores,<I> this group from Paris. Their music
sounded really electronic but in fact they were all acoustic instruments
and because the Radiophonic Workshop was a below-the-line cost she came to
the Radiophonic Workshop and the boss recommended Ron Grainer because he
had done something called "Giants of Steam". Ron saw the visual titles,
as usual something like a black and white negative, and he took the
timings and went away and wrote the score.</I>"
<BR>
"<I>On the score he'd written "sweeps", "swoops"... beautiful
words... "wind cloud", "wind bubble"... so I got to work and put it
together and when Ron heard the results, oh, he was tickled pink!</I>"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Delia, in the <A HREF="sites/interview_boa.php.html">Boazine interview</A>
<BR>
"<I>It was a magic experience because I couldn't see from the music
how it was going to sound.</I>"
<P>
"She used concrete sources and sine- and square-wave oscillators,
tuning the results, filtering and treating, cutting so that the
joins were seamless, combining sound on individual tape recorders,
re-recording the results, and repeating the process, over and over
again. When Grainer heard the result, his response was "Did I really
write that?" "<I>Most of it</I>," Delia replied.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- <A HREF="http://www.guardian.co.uk/news/2001/jul/07/guardianobituaries1">Brian Hodgson</A>
<BR>
In an official history of the first 25 years of the BBC Radiophonic Workshop,
Delia tells how she created the Dr Who theme tune with a series of
'carefully timed handswoops' over oscillators.
<P>
Dick Mills, who helped Delia create the piece, says:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
"We started with the bass line. You know those 19-inch jack-bay panels?
You could get blank panels too, to fill in between them. They were slightly
flexible, so Delia found one that made a good musical twang and played it
with her thumb. We recorded it then vari-speeded up and down to different
pitches, copied them across to another tape recorder, then made hundreds of
measured tape edits to give it the rhythm."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was the main tune played on?
"It was just a load of oscillators -- signal generators -- that someone had
connected to a little keyboard, one for each note."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about that distinctive portamento?
"Well, you just twiddled the frequency knob, of course -- how else?"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eventually, after some pre-mixing,
the elements of the entire composition
existed on three separate reels of tape, which had to be run somehow together
in sync. "Crash-sync'ing the tape recorders was Delia's speciality," says Dick.
"We had three big Phillips machines and she could get them all to run exactly
together. She'd do: one, two, three, go! -- start all three machines, then
tweak until they were exactly in sync, just like multitrack. But with
<I>Doctor Who</I> we had a bum note somewhere and couldn't find it! It wasn't
that a note was out of tune -- there was just one little piece of tape too many,
and it made the whole thing go out of sync. Eventually, after trying for ages,
we completely unwound the three rolls of tape and ran them all side by side
for miles -- all the way down the big, long corridor in Maida Vale.
We compared all three, matching the edits, and eventually found the point where
one tape got a bit longer. When we took that splice out it was back in sync, so
we could mix it all down."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Dick Mills,
"<A HREF="http://www.soundonsound.com/sos/apr08/articles/radiophonic.htm">BBC
Radiophonic Workshop</A>" in Sound On Sound magazine, April 2008.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
"<I>I did the Dr Who theme music mostly on the Jason valve
oscillators. Ron Grainer brought me the score. He expected to hire a
band to play it, but when he heard what I had done electronically,
he'd never imagined it would be so good. He offered me half of the
royalties, but the BBC wouldn't allow it. I was just on an assistant
studio manager's salary and that was it... and we got a free Radio
Times. The boss wouldn't let anybody have any sort of credit.</I>"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Delia, in
<A HREF="sites/ARTICLE2000JoHutton.html">the Hutton interview</A>
<P>
By comparison, when Kara Blake wanted to include a sample of the Doctor Who
theme in her Film Board of Canada-sponsored film
<A HREF="http://thedelianmode.com">The Delian Mode</A>, the BBC quoted her
$1000 <I>per second</I>, which would have consumed her entire budget for the
film.
<P>
The version that has Delia's stamp of approval is the 1:30 version
broadcast during the BBC Radio Scotland interview.

a letter from Martin Esslin,
Head of Drama (Sound), to Desmond Briscoe dated 30th June 1964:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have just been listening to the playback of the completed version of "THE TOWER"
and should like to express my deep appreciation for the excellent work done on
this production by Delia Derbyshire and John Harrison.  This play set them an
extremely difficult task and they rose to the challenge with a degree of
imaginative intuition and technical mastery which deserves the highest admiration
and which will inevitably earn a lion's share of any success the production may
eventually achieve.  I only wish that it were possible for the names of
contributors of this calibre to be mentioned in the credits in the Radio Times and
on the air.  But failing this I should like to register the fact that I regard
their contribution to this production as being at least of equal importance to that
of the producer himself.

sounds which would sound like a Gothic altarpiece. 'Oh,' I said,
'yes. What a good idea. But what do you really mean? What sort of
sounds?' He said 'Well, give me a pencil and paper'. I did, and with great
care and elaboration he drew me a beautiful Gothic altarpiece and said
'That's the sort of sound I want'."</I>

"Barry Bermange said that he himself thought of <I>Amor Dei</I> as
&lsquo;rather in the manner of a Renaissance painting with the believers in God
in the foreground or centre and half-hidden disbelievers looking out from
shadowy places round the edge of the painting.&rsquo;
<BR>He has made this programme in four sections. In the first you will hear
several thoughtful voices groping towards God, feeling their way into something
undefined. In the second, some more assured voices cite concrete images; a
defined notion of God begins to emerge. The third is a contest between those
who love God and those who cannot believe in Him. The assured and confident
voices in the last section are inspired by absolute faith."

"<I>Most of the programs that I did were either in the far distant
future, the far distant past or in the mind. I think this was the
climax of a science fiction play called "The Prophet". It ended up
with all these robots and they sang a song of praise to this bloke,
presumably the prophet, and this was the song they sang.
It is difficult to pronounce because it's made from backwards chanting and
I think if you play it forwards it would say something like "Praise to
the master, his wisdom and his reason" and I just chose the best bits and
"Ziwzih Ziwzih", "his wiz, his wiz": it's that backwards. And I must say
that the Oo-oo-oo is electronic! I think it was at the same time as one
of the Beatles' songs, "Please please me", and so that was like, I think,
er, Drew said he thought it sounded medieval. Well that was because it
was like a new religion and they'd go back to square one and the perfect
fifth as the greeks did. And so my oo-oo-oo's were done on the Wobbulator.

The actors, I got them to chant. The words they were singing were,
"Praise to the master, his wisdom and his [reason]" [...]
I turned it backwards first, then chose the best bits
that sounded good backwards and would fit into a rhythm, and then
speed-changed the voices. Then I used just this one bar repeated which
had [previously] been rejected from
<A HREF="#ScienceAndHealth">a science and health program</A>
for being too lascivious for the schoolchildren. It was like a science
program... it was supposed to be about sex, but under another name.
And then the producer had the nerve to turn down my music, saying it
was too lascivious. It was just twangy things with electronic pick-ups,
and I just used a single note and then did little glissandos on it and
pitched it and treated it. But the 'Ooh-ooh-ooh' isn't me... that's

<BR>"An unreleased perv-pop classic in the 1966 novelty
vein, recorded with Anthony Newley. The future Mr Joan
Collins was after an electronic backing track and called in
Delia.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- <A HREF="http://delia-derbyshire.org">delia-derbyshire.org</A>
<BR>It was played at the 
<A HREF="#UnitDeltaPlusConcertOfElectronicMusic"><B>Unit Delta Plus Concert of
Electronic Music</B></A>, 10th September 1966, then went unheard until 2001.
<BR>
"This electronic pop song is sung by Anthony Newley who also
wrote the words. The piece is composed in a traditional
musical way with melody, rhythm and harmony, and the musical
parameters are all totally predetermined.  The sources of
sound are simple sine tones."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- from the concert programme
<BR>
"<I>The late Anthony Newley told his label that he wanted
to do something electronic. So they got on to me. So I
produced this bloopy track and he loved it so much he
double-tracked his voice and he used my little tune.
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;The winking knees in the rain, and their
mini-skirts. I'd done it as a lovely little innocent love
song, because he said to me that the only songs are, "I love
you, I love you" or songs saying "you've gone, you've gone."
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;I'd written this beautiful little innocent
tune, all sensitive love and innocence, and he made it into
a dirty old raincoat song. But he was really chuffed! Joan
and Jackie Collins dropped him off in a limousine at my
lovely little flat above a flower shop, and he said "If
you can write songs like this, I'll get you out of this
place"! It was only a single-track demo tape. So he rang up
his record company saying "We want to move to a multi-track
studio". Unfortunately the boss of the record company was on
holiday, and by the time he returned Anthony Newley had gone
to America with Joan Collins, so it was never released.</I>"
<BR>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;-- Delia, in
    <A HREF="sites/interview_surface.php.html">the Surface interview</A>
<BR>"Delia was initially disappointed with the recording, but as
the years passed she became exceptionally fond of it."

  <LI><A NAME=PotPourri HREF="http://wiki.delia-derbyshire.net/wiki/Pot-pourri"><B>Pot-pourri</B></A>, 5 mins
    <BR>"Each of the short sections was composed as a piece of
	introductory music for the BBC, with similar rhythms,
	melodic intervals and sound qualities."

  <LI><A NAME=RandomTogether1 HREF="http://wiki.delia-derbyshire.net/wiki/Random Together 1"><B>Random Together 1</B></A>, 20 mins
    <BR>With Peter Zinovieff.
	"The piece is in three parts. The first and last will
	have light projection by Hornsey College of Art. The
	middle section will be heard in darkness and musically
	is derived from the other two sections. A limited number
	of sounds was chosen in each section and their order and
	coincidence were selected randomly. It was determined
	beforehand what the results of any such combinations
	might be. The levels of reverberation, the rise and fall
	times, and the mixing of a large number of these sounds,
	as well as their being recorded on one or more tracks,
	werre also determined by probabilistic methods. The
	different quality of the first and last sections is
	due to the difference in pitch of the tones initially
	chosen and the probabilistic selection of time intervals,
	loudnesses and switching from track to track. In this
	way the spatial structure is also varied. This will be
	especially apparent in the transition between the central
	section and the last section where the sound will appear
	from several different directions. The central section
	is the only one which is musically self-sufficient. The
	other two were composed with light projection in mind.

    "<I>Now let us go back to the last fifties, early sixties. Dave
    Brubeck had done "Take Five" and in '61 he'd done "It's a Raggy
    Waltz" so - that was in seven time - so I thought "Fine! I'm
    into the numbers game. I'll do eleven time and thirteen time",
    continuing the series of prime numbers. But unfortunately
    that style, I was told, was "too sophisticated for the BBC2
    audience" and so, as I was doing it, the choreographer Vin
    Davis [sp?] happened to be walking down the corridor and his
    feet started tapping and he said "I want that!" and I said "No,
    you can't! I've done it for the BBC." And so he implored me to do
    something in the same style, in eleven time and thirteen time, for
    his dance group, which I did. In fact it was the Frankie Howerd
    and Cilla Black show it was originally done for, but it had to be
    scrapped from that because they did the stupid thing of putting
    this rather delicate music as an opener to the second act. [...]
    A friend told me that by one means or another it ended up as
    a backing for a deodorant commercial on television which is
    something of course we were absolutely forbidden to do but it
    was nothing of my doing. It was rejected by BBC2 and there it
    was on the commercial.</I>"

K.4 (Kinetic four dimensional
Brighton Festival: West Pier: April 14th - 30th

The advanced Studies Group of Hornsey College of Art initiates experiments
in kinetic/audio/visual environments collectively titled K.4.

Assisted by staff and students of Fine Art, Visual Research, Three
Dimensional Design, Post Diploma and Film and Television Departments, the
following features are presented:

<U>Kinetic Arena</U>
A white elliptical cyclorama 60' x 80' together with the white painters lattice
girder roof creates a large audio/visual environment.  This will be programmed
with continuously developing moving images by 10 high powered (2kw and 5kw)
automatic projectors.  An arrangement of 30 loudspeakers will provide three
dimensional sound.  From Monday to Friday, from 8 until midnight, for the two
weeks of the Festival the arena will function as a discotheque.  On the opening
night and the three following weekends special audio/visual kinetic performances
will be presented.  In addition to LIGHT/SOUND WORKSHOP performances which
include special slide projection techniques we hope to have performances by
Bruce Lacey with his robots and by Pink Floyd Sound.
[...]
<U>Kinetic Labyrinth</U>
Whilst the Arena aim to create a spacious environment for the social
activity of a large group the Labyrinth aims to provide a more enclosed and
personal experience.
    The Labyrinth is a means of presenting the work of a number of British and
foreign kinetic artists together with environments created by LIGHT/SOUND
WORKSHOP.
[...] The environments will have a number of walls which are
transparent projection screens of Perspex and other materials. Colours and
imaged will be programmed on to these together with appropriate sounds tracks.

Tuareg tribe are nomads in the Sahara desert and I think they live
by bartering, taking salt, I think it was, across the desert. In
the piece, the extract you're going to hear, I tried to convey the
distance of the horizon and the heat haze and then there's this very
high, slow reedy sound. That indicates the strand of camels seen
at a distance, wandering across the desert. That in fact was made
from square waves on the valve oscillators we've just talked about,
but square waves put though every filter I could possibly find to
take out all the bass frequencies and so one just hears the very

"the real masterpiece is "Pot Au Feu". This is three minutes and
nineteen seconds of paranoia, virtually a rave track circa 1991 in its
structure; a stattering, pounding teleprinter-paced bassline worthy of
Timbaland as the tension builds, then a moment of chaos and crisis,
an alarm-bell of a hook recalling the "panic / excitement" lines so
prevalent in early 90s hardcore."

"<I>I wanted to have, as well as a rhythmic motive, to have musical
motive running throughout the whole piece and so I interpreted the letters
again into musical terms. 'I' becomes B, the 'E' remains and 100 I've
used in the roman form of C.</I>"

A copy exists in the tapes from her attic and two short excerpts were
broadcast in the the "Sculptress of Sound" documentary on BBC Radio.

</H3>
<P>
This is the electronic soundtrack realised with Elsa Stansfield
for the 32-minute film "Circle of Light: The Photography of Pamela Bone"
directed by Anthony Roland, which won the Short Film Art Section of the
<A HREF="http://www.corkfilmfest.org/awardwinners/awards/award-17.html">17th
Cork Film Festival in 1972</A>.
<BR>
The music is a gentle half hour of real and electronic seascapes and birdsong
on a evolving background of shaped noise, introduced
and signed off by variants of the "lampshade" sound used in Golden Veils.
<BR>
(The accompanying film is a sequence of wobbly zooms and pans on bleak
seaside and woodland photographs, some of them beautiful.)
<BR>
This is by far the longest surviving single piece of her music.

"She was badly treated by the BBC, repeatedly turned down for
promotions that should have been hers. Her name was never recognised on
recordings of her works because that was BBC policy and, as an employee,
she never received a penny in royalties for Dr Who.
The money was never the issue with Delia so long as she had enough to
live on, but the lack of recognition was."

"<A HREF="http://www.nationalmediamuseum.org.uk">Bradford Museum of Film
and Television</A> has a vintage episode of Tomorrow's World featuring
Delia Derbyshire explaining the musique-concrete methods adopted at the
Radiophonic Workshop when creating those inimitable TV soundtracks. DD
almost started dancing at one point. It was incredible..."
<P>
The Museum's "TV Heaven" archive used to list this item as
"Tomorrow's World (Radiophonic Workshop), 1965, 30 mins"
but it doesn't any more.
However, there is <A HREF="sites/tvdetails.asp.html">a local copy
of the index card</A> here.
To book a viewing, call the TV Heaven desk directly on (01274) 203433,
although booking is not always necessary.

    "Delia Derbyshire once spoke (in a radio documentary on the history of the Workshop, broadcast in April 1979 on Radio 3)
    of the antiquated chaos and DIY bodge-jobs that was the Workshop's equipment
    base in the 1960s, and how enormously long tape loops could frequently be
    seen trailing out into the corridor."
