<H1 ALIGN=CENTER>Notes on Delia Derbyshire's papers</H1>
<P>
The paper originals consist of a supermarket cardboard box full of manila
folders, each containing hundreds of sheets of paper. They are currently
in the custody of David Butler at Manchester University and are scheduled
to be transferred to one of the Manchester public libraries some time in
Summer 2010.
<P>
I had the brief opportunity of a day and a half to study them; estimating
twenty folders with a hundred items in each would give me 36 seconds per
sheet. I could do no more than photograph them all with a camera phone for
later study, limiting my study there on the spot to simply boggling at them.
<P>
They contains her original pencilled manuscript scores for many of the
known pieces and for for dozens of hitherto unknown ones as well as
exact synthesizer settings for the VCS3 and sheets covered in mathematical
formulae, tables of numbers, circuit diagrams as well as unconventional
notations for electronic sounds in the form of wavy diagrams and schemes
on graph paper.
<P>
I am currently at a loss how to order and extract the useful information
from this to present it to people. Several other musicians and Delian
musicologists are also boggling at them as I write - all this site does
at present is to make them available and provide a name for talking about
the individual sheets (their dd012345 number).

<P>
The highest-definition versions of the photos (2048x1536) were taken with a
Google Android phone, the HTC Dream G1 developer version, backing each sheet
with several layers of white "photocopier paper".
<P>
The evening of the first day (images up to dd094644) I saw that that the auto
focus had sometimes got confused by the room's fluorescent strip lighting so
on the second day (dd095538 onwards) I took two or three snaps of the most important
documents (her scores and musical notes) and have selected the "best" of the
multiple images, partly by eye and partly by the size of the jpegs (all else
being equal, bigger indicates finer detail, sharper constrast).
<P>
The resulting JPGs were then rotated using jpegtran, which rotates the compressed
data without decoding re-encoding it, so the rotated versions are exactly as high
quality as the originals.
